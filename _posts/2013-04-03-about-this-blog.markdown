I have never been a heavy blogger; however, I like to have a space where I can occasionally publish my thoughts on (mainly) data related topics.

I had to reevaluate my options after Twitter announced the end of Posterous. I had tried Wordpress and Blogger in the past but never really felt comfortable with them. So, I finally decided to go for something quite different.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), a static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub"). That means that I can write locally on my machine, in a text editor, and then generate the site locally before it is pushed to GitHub.

I used [Jekyll Bootstrap and Tom Preston-Werner's theme](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/preview/tom/) to avoid the pain of manually designing something nice! 

I like what I learnt so far! Let's see how that works out...

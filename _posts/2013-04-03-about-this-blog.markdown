I have never been a heavy blogger; however, I like to have a space where I can occasionally publish my thoughts on (mainly) data analysis.

I had to reevaluate my options after Twitter announced the end of Posterous. I had tried Wordpress and Blogger in the past but never really felt comfortable with them. So, I finally decided to go for something quite different.

This blog is built with Jekyll, a static site generator, and hosted on GitHub. That means that I can write locally on my machine in a text editor and then generate the site locally before it is pushed to GitHub.

I used Jekyll Bootstrap and Tom Preston-Werner's theme to avoid the pain of manually designing something nice! 

I like what I learnt so far! Let's see how that works out...

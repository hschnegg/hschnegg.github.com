Thank you for visiting my personal blog!

I am a London based data geek with a long experience in data warehousing and business intelligence. 
My current focus is on gaining a deeper understanding of data mining. Part of that effort involves studying a Stanford University's Data Mining and Applications Graduate Certificate.
In the meantime, I also try to get involved in practical data mining projects. I intend to use my blog to keep track of that journey.
